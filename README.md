What is Money Jar?
==================

Money jar is or will be a web-based personal money management application, that analyzes 
your personal financial history and produces graphical reports to show you how well you 
are managing your money.

The reports will:

  * Allow you to see how much you are spending in comparison to your income.
  * Show you whether you are living within your means.
  * Show you what you are spending your money on.
  * Show you where you can save money, or cut back spending.
  * Allow you to budget for future purchases.
  * Allow you to see a summarized view of your financial commitments.
  * Help you decide whether you are earning enough to take on further commitments.
